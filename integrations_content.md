### Integrations

All integrations include an overview of how the integration is implemented and instructions for installing and configuring software required for the integration implementation.

Featured and Data Collector integrations have metrics and content:

- **Metrics** - metrics sent by the integration and the rate that the integration is sending metrics. Each integration defines a set of "canary" metrics that indicate when the integration is functioning correctly. The Metrics tab displays charts of these canary metrics. You can also click any metric to display a chart of the metric. 
- **Content** - pre-defined dashboards that highlight important metrics or illustrate techniques for querying metrics. Some dashboards contain pre-defined alert conditions that are embedded as queries in charts on the dashboards. You can install and uninstall the dashboards.
