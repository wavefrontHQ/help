### Organization Security Settings

As an administrator with **Accounts** permission, on the **Security** tab, you can set access to newly created dashboards and alerts:

* If you select  **Grant Modify Access To: Everyone**, you give access to all user accounts that belong to the **Everyone** group.
* If you select **Grant Modify Access To: Everyone** and select the **Service Accounts** check box, you give access to user accounts that belong to the **Everyone** group and all service accounts that belong to the **Service Accounts** group.
* If you select **Grant Modify Access To: Object Creator**, access to new dashboards and new alerts is initially limited to the dashboard creator and the Super Admin users.

Any change that you make applies only to the dashboards and alerts created after the change. If you change the setting to **Object Creator**, only new dashboards and alerts have restricted access. If you later change the setting to **Everyone**, all dashboards and alerts that were created while the setting was **Object Creator** keep the restricted access.
