### What Is an Integration?

Operations for Applications integrations are the link between any system and VMware Aria Operations for Applications. Integration links can be from your system into Operations for Applications or from Operations for Applications to an external system: data collector, alert notification, and authentication.

**Integration Categories**<br/>
Integrations are grouped into different categories. **Featured**, collector, and code instrumentation integrations include all ways to get data into Operations for Applications: using a collector agent and Wavefront proxy, sending metrics from application code to the proxy, and Operations for Applications pulling the data from a cloud service. 

To see the full list of categories, under **Type** click **See All**.

**Integration States**<br/>
Integration states depend on two factors:

* Whether metrics ever reported and whether they reported in the last 2 hours or in the last 7 days.
* The state of content installation, such as installed, never installed, or uninstalled

To filter the integrations by state, click a state from the left panel.
