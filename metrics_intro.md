### What Is a Metric?

A metric is a quantitative measure of a system property used to track health or performance. Operations for Applications supports metrics
in its own [data format](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_data_format.html) as well as other standard formats, such as [Graphite](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),  [OpenTSDB](http://opentsdb.net/docs/build/html/user_guide/writing), and formats generated by cloud-based services
such as [AWS](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_metrics.html).

Once metrics are ingested into Operations for Applications, administrators can [query](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_getting_started.html) and
[chart](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html) the data to help understand underlying patterns. You can create
[alerts](https://docs.wavefront.com/alerts_manage.html) to notify operators when anomalous values indicate a problem.

All users can then receive [alerts](https://docs.wavefront.com/alerts.html), drill down into the prepared dashboards and charts, and start finding the root cause for problems.

The retention period varies based on the metric type:
* Persistent metrics are retained for 18 months. By default, all ingested metrics are persistent but convertible.
* Ephemeral metrics are retained for 28 days. By default, only the [internal metrics](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront-internal-metrics.html) are ephemeral and they are not convertible.

A Super Admin user in Super Admin mode can change the ephemerality of individual metrics or metrics namespaces. Converting persistent metrics to ephemeral improves the query performance and reduces the cardinality.

[Obsolete metrics](https://docs.wavefront.com/metrics_managing.html#obsolete-metrics) are automatically hidden. You can also manually hide metrics. Hidden metrics are removed from autocomplete, but you can still use them in queries when data values are present.

**Note**: The obsolescence period for metrics and sources might vary. You can see your current configuration by looking into the Advanced settings of any [chart](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html#include-metrics-that-stopped-reporting) or [dashboard](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#set-dashboard-display-preferences-and-settings). To change this configuration, contact [Technical Support](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_support_feedback.html).
