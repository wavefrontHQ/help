### Super Admin User

When a company signs up with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, we create a Super Admin user who has full administrative privileges.
* All permissions
* View, modify, and share restricted objects

A Super Admin user can invite other users to become Super Admin, and can view orphan dashboards. These dashboards were created by users who were later deleted, and were never shared. Super Admin can share orphan dashboards or delete them.
