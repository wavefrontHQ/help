### Super Admin User

When a company signs up with Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, we create a Super Admin user who has full administrative privileges.
* All permissions
* View, modify, and share restricted objects
* Upgrade from a trial version and purchase initial and additional Wavefront capacity.

A Super Admin user can invite other users to become Super Admin, and can view orphan dashboards. These dashboards were created by users who were later deleted, and were never shared. A Super Admin user can share orphan dashboards or delete them.
