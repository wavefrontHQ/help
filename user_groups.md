### Managing Groups
Groups allow you to manage the roles assigned to a number of accounts altogether.

By default, all service accounts belong to the **Service Accounts** system group, and all user accounts belong to the **Everyone** system group.

From this page, users with the **Accounts** permission can:
* Create, edit, and delete groups. You cannot delete a system group.
* Add account to groups and remove accounts from groups. Accounts can be user accounts and service accounts. One account can belong to many groups. You cannot change the members of a system group. 
* Assign roles to groups and revoke roles from groups. You cannot assign permissions to groups.

You can also select one or more roles on the left to see which groups have these roles.
