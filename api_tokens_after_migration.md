### Viewing and Managing Operations for Applications API Tokens

As an **Admin** user, you can view the Operations for Applications API tokens in your service, examine their usage, and revoke a token, if needed.

**Important:** This page shows the Operations for Applications API tokens of your service accounts, which are **restricted** to support only a [limited list](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_onboarded_subscriptions.html#integrations-that-use-operations-for-applications-api-tokens). In all other cases, you should authenticate with the more secure VMware Cloud services access tokens by using server to server OAuth apps or VMware Cloud services API tokens.

On this page, you can:
* Sort the API tokens by clicking the arrows in the column headers.
* Search and, optionally, save and share your search by using the Search field above the tokens table.
* Filter the API tokens by usage, particular accounts, or your saved search by using the filters on the left.
* Revoke an API token by clicking the ellipsis icon for the token and selecting **Revoke**.

**Important:** Revoking a token cannot be undone. Any script that uses a revoked token returns an authorization error.
