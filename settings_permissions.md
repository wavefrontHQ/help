### Managing Permissions

[Permissions](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_roles.html) determine which Tanzu Observability features are exposed to users and groups and what actions those users can perform. You can grant users and groups new permissions, set the default permissions of new users, and revoke permissions.

To see your own permissions, click the gear icon and select your name.
