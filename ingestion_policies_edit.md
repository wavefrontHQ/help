### Editing an Ingestion Policy
You can edit an ingestion policy and the alert associated with the PPS limit.

* You cannot change the policy scope. You can only add and remove accounts or objects from that scope.
* Removing the PPS limit dissociates the alert from the ingestion policy and deletes the alert.
* Editing an ingestion policy creates a new version of that policy. Only Super Admin users can view the policy versions.
