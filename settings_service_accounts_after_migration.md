### Managing Service Accounts
A service account authenticates with an Operations for Applications API token.

By default all service accounts belong to the **Service Accounts** internal system group.

From this page, **Admin** users can:
* Create and delete service accounts.
* Deactivate and activate service accounts.
* Generate, revoke, and rename API tokens for service accounts.
* Manage the permissions assigned to service accounts.
