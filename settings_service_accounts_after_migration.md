### Managing Service Accounts
A service account is for services that use the API to perform certain tasks. Service accounts use a token to authenticate and are constrained from performing certain UI operations.

By default all service accounts belong to the **Service Accounts** internal system group.

From this page, users with the **Admin** permission can:
* Create and delete service accounts.
* Deactivate and activate service accounts.
* Generate, revoke, and rename API tokens for service accounts.
* Manage the permissions assigned to service accounts.
