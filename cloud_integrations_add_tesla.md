### Add a Tesla Integration

Adding a Tesla integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Tesla and Tanzu Observability by Wavefront by sharing account details. That way, you ensure that nobody else can monitor your Tesla and, for example, see where it's located.  We require your name and the email and password you use to log in to your Tesla account.
