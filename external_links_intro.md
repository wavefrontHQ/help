### What Is an External Link?

External links provide integration between Tanzu Observability by Wavefront and external systems. If you use logging systems such as ELK or
Splunk, you can easily construct a meaningful URL to navigate from Tanzu Observability to a log entry.

Suppose while analyzing metrics data you find an anomaly such as an unexpected drop in transaction rate.
You want to navigate to logs to look for entries that could explain why the transaction rate drop occurred.
External links allow you to click through from a Tanzu Observability series directly to a related entry in your
logging system.

External links are general purpose: you can link through to any type of system, not just logs.
