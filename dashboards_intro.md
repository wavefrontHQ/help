### What Is a Dashboard?

Dashboards group a set of related [charts](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html). All charts in a dashboard share [display preferences](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#set-dashboard-display-preferences-and-settings),[variables](https://docs.wavefront.com/dashboards_variables.html), and [events](https://docs.wavefront.com/charts_events_displaying.html#control-event-overlays). 

Within dashboards you can use [sections](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html) to further organize charts.
