You have to grant Tanzu Observability with read-only access to your Amazon account so that we can show you your metrics. Run the Amazon **Create Role** wizard where you specify an account. After you create an account, navigate to it, and click it. From the Summary page you can copy the Role ARN containing the Amazon account ID. Then, on the Setup tab, set up the integration.
