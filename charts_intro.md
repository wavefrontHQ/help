### Visualizing Metrics

Charts let you [view the status of your metrics](ui_examine_data.html). You can organize charts into dashboards and customize the dashboard and its charts.

You add [Wavefront Query Language](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_getting_started.html) queries to charts to view metrics and to perform operations such as aggregation on them. You can customize many [chart options](http://docs.wavefront.com/ui_chart_reference.html).

### Interacting with Charts and Dashboards

VMware Aria Operations for Applications provides many ways to interact with charts and dashboards.
* In [dashboards](ui_dashboards.html), you can change time windows, share links, apply global queries, isolate sources and series, and zoom in and out.
* In [charts](ui_charts.html) you can use the following hot keys:
  - Shift to see full precision values in the legend.
  - Option to see a fish-eye view at the cursor.
