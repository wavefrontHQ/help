### Add an Amazon Web Services Cloud Integration

Setting up an Amazon cloud integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Tanzu Observability by Wavefront. 

You start by granting Tanzu Observability [read-only access to your Amazon account](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_overview.html#give-read-only-access-to-your-amazon-account-and-get-the-role-arn) or by giving [limited access](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_overview.html#giving-limited-access).

Then, you register the integration by providing the necessary information. See [AWS Integration Overview](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_aws_overview.html) for information about setting up and managing the AWS Cloud integration.
