<p>First, have a look at how Wavefront works. Wavefront consists of the Wavefront cloud service and the Wavefront proxy.</p>

<p>For most hosts, applications, and services, an agent collects metrics and pushes them to a Wavefront proxy running within your infrastructure. The proxy forwards collected metrics to the Wavefront cloud service while providing authentication, buffering, metrics pre-processing, and more.</p>

<p>Metrics for cloud services are pulled directly by Wavefront. Wavefront can get metrics from, for example, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Azure. </p>
