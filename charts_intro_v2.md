### Visualizing Metrics

Charts let you [view the status of your metrics](http://docs.wavefront.com/ui_examine_data.html). You can organize charts into dashboards and customize the dashboard and its charts.

You use Query Editor to specify the metrics you're interested in. Customize your queries using [Wavefront Query Language](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_reference.html). and customize the chart using the [chart editor tabs](http://docs.wavefront.com/ui_chart_reference.html).

### Interacting with Charts and Dashboards

You can customize charts and dashboards in many ways:
* In [dashboards](http://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html), you can change time windows, define and select variables, share links, apply global queries, isolate sources and series, and zoom in and out.
* In [charts](http://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html) you can fine-tune queries and customize how the chart looks. You can use these hot keys:
  - Shift-P to pin the legend
  - Shift to see full precision values in the legend.
  - Option to see a fish-eye view at the cursor.
