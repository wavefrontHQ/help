### Alerts Analytics (Technology Demo)

See a daily report on the health of your alerts. Use this report to periodically clean up and update your alerts, ensuring optimal alerts management at all times.

**Important**: This page refreshes every 24 hours. The information is based on the data from the last 24-hour period.

* The **Alert Usage** progress bar shows the number of your alerts out of your alerts limit. **Note**: If you reach the alerts limit, you cannot create an alert until you delete an existing one.
* The **Failed Alerts** card shows the number of alerts with queries that failed to return results.
* The **Failed Alert Reason** chart shows the distribution of failed alerts by failure cause.
* The **Alerts with No Target** card shows the number of alerts that don't have recipients to notify when the alerts trigger.
* The **Alerts with No Data** card shows the number of alerts with queries that have no data during the last trigger or resolve window.

The **Alert List** table shows the actual alerts that need attention. These alerts are organized in the **Failed Alerts**, **Alerts with No Target**, and **Alerts with No Data** tabs. Consider updating or deleting some of these alerts to improve your overall alerts experience.

To make the necessary changes to an alert query, snooze an alert, or delete a failed alert, open the alert from the **Alert List** table:
1. Click the name of the alert. A dialog box with the alert details appears.
2. In the alert dialog box, click **View Alert**. The alert opens in a new tab in edit mode.
