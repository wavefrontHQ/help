### What Is the Log Browser?

You can use the Log Browser to search and filter logs so that you can find the root cause of critical issues in your system.

Tanzu Observability retains logs for 7, 15, or 30 days, based on your settings. 

**Step 1: Send Logs**

Configure your application or environment to [send logs to Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_send_logs.html).

**Step 2: Search and Filter Logs**

Use the [Log Browser](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_log_browser.html) to: 
* See the logs for a specific time range.
* Filter the logs by using tags, words, application, service, and source.
* Include or exclude some of the logs from the search results, and much more.
