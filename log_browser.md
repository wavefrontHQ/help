### What Is the Logs Browser?

You can use the Logs Browser to search and filter logs so that you can find the root cause of critical issues in your system.

Operations for Applications retains logs for 30 days during the Logs free trial or retains logs for 7 days when on the freemium subscription! 

**Step 1: Send Logs**

Configure your application or environment to [send logs to Operations for Applications](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_send_logs.html).

**Step 2: Search and Filter Logs**

Use the [Logs Browser](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_log_browser.html) to: 
* See the logs for a specific time range.
* Filter the logs by using tags, words, application, service, and source.
* Include or exclude some of the logs from the search results, and much more.
