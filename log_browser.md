### What Is the Logs Browser?

You can use the Logs Browser to search logs, filter logs, and find the root cause of the critical issues in your system.

Tanzu Observability retains logs for 30 days during the Logs free trial or retains logs for 7 days when on the freemium subscription! 

**Step 1: Send Logs**

Configure your application or environment to [send logs to Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_send_logs.html).

**Step 2: Search and Filter Logs**

Use the [Logs Browser](https://docs.wavefront.com/logging_log_browser.html) to: 
* See logs for a specific time range.
* Filter logs using tags, words, applications, services, and sources.
* Include or exclude some of the logs from the search results and much more.
