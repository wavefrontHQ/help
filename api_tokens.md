### Viewing and Managing API Tokens

As a user with the **Accounts** permission, you can view the API tokens of all user and service accounts in your organization, examine their usage, and revoke a token, if needed.

**Important:** Revoking a token cannot be undone. Any script that uses a revoked token returns an authorization error.

On this page, you can:
* Sort the API tokens by clicking the arrows in the column headers.
* Search and, optionally, save and share your search by using the Search field above the tokens table.
* Filter the API tokens by account type, usage, particular accounts, or your saved search by using the filters on the left.
* Revoke an API token by clicking the ellipsis icon for the token and selecting **Revoke**.
