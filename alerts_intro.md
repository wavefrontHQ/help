### What Is an Alert?

An alert defines the conditions under which metric values or logs indicate a system problem and set of targets to be notified when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period of time. You only see the logs alerts if you Alerts and Logs permissions.

**Manage Metrics Alerts**
 When a metrics alert changes state, notifications are sent to targets such as email addresses, pager services, and real-time communication channels.

To disable checking alert conditions, you can snooze alerts for a fixed time window or put a set of alerts or sources in a custom [maintenance window](https://docs.wavefront.com/maintenance_windows_managing.html#creating-a-maintenance-window).

**Managing Logs Alerts**

You can create logs alerts and get notifications when the alerts fire. On the Logs Alerts page, you see the state of the log alert (can be checking, snoozed, or disabled state) and the number of times an alert fired.

You can filter the alerts based on the alert state, severity, or use a search you saved.
