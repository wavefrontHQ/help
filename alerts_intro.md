### What Is an Alert?

An alert defines the conditions under which metric values or logs data indicate a system problem when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period. 

**Manage Metrics Alerts**
 
 When a metrics alert changes state, our service sends notifications to the targets your define, such as email addresses, pager services, and real-time communication channels.

To pause the checking alert conditions, you can snooze alerts for a fixed time window or put a set of alerts or sources in a custom [maintenance window](https://docs.wavefront.com/maintenance_windows_managing.html#creating-a-maintenance-window).

**Managing Logs Alerts**

You can create logs alerts and see the firing events of a logs alert. If you have Logs permissions, you see the **Logs Alert** tab, which lists the logs alerts you create. If you have Logs and Alerts permissions, you can create and manage logs alerts. 

On the Logs Alerts page, you see the state of the log alert and the number of times an alert fired. You can also snooze logs alerts for a fixed time window.
