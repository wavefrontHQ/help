### What is an Alert?

An alert defines the conditions under which metric values indicate a system problem and set of targets to be notified when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified period of time. When an alert changes state, notifications are sent to targets such as email addresses, pager services, and real-time communication channels.

To disable checking alert conditions, you can snooze alerts for a fixed time window or put a set of alerts or sources in a custom [maintenance window](https://docs.wavefront.com/maintenance_windows_managing.html#creating-a-maintenance-window).
