### Organization Default Settings

As a user with the **Accounts** permission, on the **New Accounts Defaults** tab, you can set preferences for your service instance:

* Globally set whether Getting Started Progress display is the default. 
* Set a default landing page - a dashboard that you specify or the dashboard list. 
* Set the default query language preferences and optionally, allow users to write queries in PromQL. 
* When the default query language is WQL, you can also set whether Query Editor or Chart Builder is the default query builder. 
* Add default groups for new user accounts. New users are assigned to the **Everyone** system group and to all additional default groups that you specify. Permissions are additive.
* Add default groups for new service accounts. New users are assigned to the **Service Accounts** system group and to all additional default groups that you specify. Permissions are additive.
* Set the default permissions for new user accounts. These permissions don't apply to service accounts

Individual users can override some of these settings by clicking the gear icon and selecting [their user account](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html).
