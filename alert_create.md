### Creating Alerts

An alert is a condition and set of targets to be notified when the condition evaluates to true or false for a specified
period of time. You express conditions using [ts() queries](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_getting_started.html) and
operators.

You can send alert notifications to various types of targets: email addresses, pager services such as
PagerDuty and VictorOps, or communication channels such as Slack. You can also invoke an [alert notification](https://docs.wavefront.com/webhooks_alert_notification.html) or configure arbitrary actions such as running an auto-remediation script.
