### Who Is the Super Admin User?

Users with the VMware Cloud **Organization Owner** and **Organization Administrator** roles can assign the **Super Admin** Operations for Applications service role. After enabling Super Admin mode, a Super Admin user:
* Has all Operations for Applications permissions
* Can view, modify, and share restricted objects
* Can view orphan dashboards. These dashboards were created by users who were later deleted, and were never shared. A Super Admin user can share orphan dashboards or delete them.
