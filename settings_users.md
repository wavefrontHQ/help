### Managing User Accounts
Users authenticate with a username and a password.

From this page, users with the **Accounts** permission can:
* Invite new users to your company's Operations for Applications environment.
* Assign groups, roles, and permissions to users.
* Revoke groups, roles, and permissions from users.

You can also select one or more permissions, groups, and roles on the left to see which users match the selections.
