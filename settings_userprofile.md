### Manage Your User Information

On this page, you can update your user preferences:

* Set display preferences (including a dark theme).
* Set whether Getting Started Progress display is the default, set the chart title size, and turn sampling on and off.
* Set a default landing page - a dashboard that you specify or the dashboard list.
* If your Super Admin has enabled you to write queries in PromQL, you can set the preferred query settings. 
* If WQL is your default query language, you can select [Chart Builder](https://docs.wavefront.com/chart_builder.html) as the default or select the Query Editor.
