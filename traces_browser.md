### What Is Traces Browser? 

Explore the details of your application’s traces: 

* **Query for traces** using the trace ID and span tags. 
* **Sort traces** by outliers, most errors, longest, and more. 
* **Examine the spans** that belong to a selected trace. 
* **Drill down** into spans and view span tags and span logs. 
* **Examine the critical path** (orange line), an end-to-end sequence of blocking spans. Each blocking span must complete before the trace can complete. 
* **Download traces** and view them later using the Offline Traces page.
* **Get a link and share** what you’re seeing right now (NON-LIVE display) with other users.
