### Managing Preferences

You can set preferences for every user in your account. You can set the default dashboard and whether to enable [Query Builder](https://docs.wavefront.com/query_language_query_builder.html).

Users can override these preferences in their [user profile](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html#configuring-your-preferences).
