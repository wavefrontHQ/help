### Managing Preferences

You can set preferences for every user in your account. You can set the default dashboard and whether to enable [Chart Builder](https://docs.wavefront.com/chart_builder.html).

Users can override these preferences in their [user profile](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_account_managing.html#configure-user-preferences).
