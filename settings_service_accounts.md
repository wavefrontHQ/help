### Managing Service Accounts
Service accounts use Operations for Applications API tokens to authenticate.

**Important**: The usage of service accounts is **restricted** to support only a [limited list](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_onboarded_subscriptions.html#integrations-that-use-operations-for-applications-api-tokens) of integrations that still authenticate with Operations for Applications API tokens. In all other cases, you should use [server to server OAuth apps](https://docs.wavefront.com/csp_server_to_server_apps.html) which authenticate with the more secure VMware Cloud services access tokens.

From this page, **Admin** users can:
* Create and delete service accounts.
* Deactivate and activate service accounts.
* Generate, revoke, and rename API tokens for service accounts.
* Manage the permissions assigned to service accounts.

You can also select one or more permissions on the left to see which service accounts have these permissions.
