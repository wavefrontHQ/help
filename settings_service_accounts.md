### Managing Service Accounts

A service account is for services that use the Wavefront API to perform certain tasks. Service accounts use a token to authenticate and are constrained from performing certain UI operations.

You must have the **Accounts** permission to create and manage service accounts and their tokens.

By default all service accounts belong to the **Service Accounts** system group.

From this page, you can:
* Create and delete service accounts.
* Deactivate and activate service accounts.
* Generate, revoke, and rename API tokens for service accounts.
* Manage the permissions, roles, and groups assigned to service accounts. You cannot revoke the **Service Accounts** system group. In most situations, it's best to assign permissions directly to the service account.
