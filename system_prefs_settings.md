### Organization Default Settings

On this page, you can set preferences for your service instance:

* Globally set whether Getting Started Progress display is the default. 
* Set a default landing page - a dashboard that you specify or the dashboard list. 
* Set the default query language preferences and optionally, allow users to write queries in PromQL. 
* When the default query language is WQL, you can also set whether Query Editor or Chart Builder is the default query builder. 

Individual users can override some of these settings by clicking the gear icon and selecting [their user account](https://docs.wavefront.com/csp_users_account_managing.html).
