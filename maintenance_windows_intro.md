### What is a Maintenance Window?

A maintenance window is a time window when disruptive operations occur as a result of system maintenance or testing. These disruptive operations create a high likelihood of causing alerts to fire. A maintenance window
allows you to identify when maintenance is scheduled and which subset of alerts and sources are affected.

You can close (end) maintenance windows before they are due to end and you can extend the end time by various increments.
