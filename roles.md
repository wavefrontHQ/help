### Managing Roles
Roles allow you to assign a combination of permissions to groups and accounts, so that you make sure nobody can perform tasks without the corresponding permission.

From this page, users with the **Accounts** permission can:

* Create, edit, and delete roles.
* Grant permissions to roles and revoke permissions from roles.
* Assign roles to groups and revoke roles from groups. This is the most efficient and least error-prone approach.
* Assign roles to accounts and revoke roles from accounts.

You can also select one or more permissions, groups, and accounts on the left to see which roles match the selections.
