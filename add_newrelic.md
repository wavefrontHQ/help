### Adding New Relic Integration

Adding a New Relic integration requires establishing a trust relationship between New Relic and Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.


1. Navigate to the New Relic API Key generator in your New Relic instance.
2. Generate a key.
3. Copy the key and paste in into the API Key field in the integration setup.
4. (Optional) Add source filters and metric filters.

You can then configure Tanzu Observability to continually load application data.
