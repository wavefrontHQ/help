### Adding New Relic Integration

Adding a New Relic integration requires establishing a trust relationship between New Relic and Wavefront.


1. Navigate to the New Relic API Key generator in your New Relic instance.
2. Generate a key.
3. Copy the key and paste in into the API Key field in the integration setup.
4. (Optional) Add source filters and metric filters.

You can then configure Wavefront to continually load application data.
