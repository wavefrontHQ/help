### View History and Revert an Ingestion Policy Version
Every time a user with the **Ingestion Policies** permission edits an ingestion policy, they create a new version of that policy.

As a user with the **Ingestion Policies** permission, on this pge you can:

* See the details of each version of the policy - the user who updated the policy and created the version, when was the policy updated, and what was updated in the policy.
* Open the current policy dashboard by clicking the current version number.
* Revert the policy to an exact copy of an earlier version by clicking the ellipsis icon for the target version and selecting **Revert**. This way, you create a new version that is an exact copy of the target version.
* Edit a copy of an earlier version and and revert the policy to it by clicking the number of the target earlier version. After you make your changes and click **Revert to version**, you create a new version that is an edited copy of the target version.
