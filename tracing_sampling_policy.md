### What Is a Sampling Policy? 

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront [intelligent sampling](http://docs.wavefront.com/trace_data_sampling.html) retains traces that are likely to be informative, such as traces with errors or traces that take a long time to complete. If you want more control over the traces you want to retain in Tanzu Observability, you can create a sampling policy to keep the spans you specify. 

With sampling policies, you retain more data than default intelligent sampling. That requires more storage and affects your cost.
