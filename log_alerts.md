## Managing Log Alerts

You can create log alerts and get notifications when the alerts fire. On this Log Alerts page, you see:
* The log alerts you created.
* The state of the log alert (can be checking, snoozed, or disabled state). 
* The number of times an alert fired.
* When the alert was last updated.

You can filter the alerts based on the alert state, severity, or use a search you saved.
