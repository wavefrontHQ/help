## Managing Log Alerts

You can create alert logs and get notifications when the alerts fire. On this log alert list page, you see:
* The log alerts you created.
* The state of the log alert (checking, snoozed, or disabled state). 
* The number of times the alerts fired.
* When the alert was last updated.

You can filter the alerts based on the severity or use a search you saved.
