### What Is Application Status? 

See the overall health of each application using the application map, table view, and grid view. 

[**Application Map**](https://docs.wavefront.com/tracing_ui_overview.html#app_map)<br/> 
Get an overview of how the applications and services are linked. Focus on a specific service, and view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service and for the tracing traffic in the application.  

[**Table View**](https://docs.wavefront.com/tracing_ui_overview.html#table_view)<br/>
View RED metrics at a glance, see changes (Δ value) in RED metrics, and sort data.  

[**Grid view**](https://docs.wavefront.com/tracing_ui_overview.html#grid_view)<br/> 
Examine the RED metrics for each of the application’s services. 

From each view, drill down to the Service Dashboard and Traces Browser.
